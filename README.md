## Expense Tracker with Authentication

<hr>

Hey there! This is my little project to build a super Simple Expense Tracker. The goal is to help me (and maybe you!) keep tabs on where all the money goes. It's still a work in progress, but here's what's cooking!

- User authentication (Firebase or Express+JWT)
- Frontend: React with Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js Express with MongoDB
- CRUD operations
- At last: Graphs for expenseÂ categories

**Designed myself this is how it could look in future**
