## Expense Tracker with Authentication

Hey there! This is my little project to build a super Simple Expense Tracker. The goal is to help me (and maybe you!) keep tabs on where all the money goes. It's still a work in progress, but here's what's cooking! ðŸš€

- User authentication (Firebase or Express+JWT)
- Frontend: React with Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js Express with MongoDB
- CRUD operations
- At last: Graphs for expense categories

**Here's a sneak peek of the design:** âœ¨
